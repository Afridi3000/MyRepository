Since July 2024, I have been an integral part of the Delivery Assurance Reporting and Transformations (DART) team, specifically within the Global CIS division. My role encompasses both technical and financial responsibilities, allowing me to contribute to multiple facets of our operations.

Technical Responsibilities:

In my technical capacity, I manage and maintain Power BI dashboards, ensuring they are refreshed daily and accurately reflect the latest data. This involves loading data into databases, troubleshooting any issues that arise during the refresh process, and implementing updates or enhancements as needed. My proactive approach has been instrumental in identifying and resolving bugs, thereby ensuring the reliability and efficiency of our reporting tools.

Additionally, I leverage Microsoft Power Platform tools—such as Power Apps and Power Automate—to develop solutions that streamline workflows and automate repetitive tasks. My work with SharePoint includes managing document libraries and integrating them with other Microsoft services to facilitate seamless collaboration across teams.

Financial Responsibilities:

On the financial front, I collaborate closely with Engagement Managers and PMOs to set up engagements within our E-Monitoring system. This involves interpreting contract documents to determine the most effective setup configurations, ensuring alignment between cost, revenue, and invoicing data. I assist stakeholders in understanding any discrepancies or misalignments in financial data, providing insights and recommendations to optimize their current setups.

Furthermore, I manage access permissions within the E-Monitoring system, granting appropriate levels of access at both the engagement and business unit levels. This ensures that stakeholders have the necessary visibility into financial data pertinent to their roles.
